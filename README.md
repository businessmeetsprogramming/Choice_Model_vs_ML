# Choice_Model_vs_ML

This repo contains the appendix pages that are related to the implementation details of the case study in the paper, [Customer Choice Models versus Machine Learning: Finding Optimal Product Displays on Alibaba](https://github.com/businessmeetsprogramming/Choice_Model_vs_ML)

This repo contains two items:
  * The first item is a PDF file, which is part of the appendix of our paper. This appendix includes the proof and the estimation code for our numerical experiment in the paper.
  * The second item is a Jupyter notebook that explains our new optimization algorithm in the paper. Note that this implementation is purely for educational purposes and differs from the actual implementation used in the paper's experiment. The real implementation in the paper is proprietary and cannot be publicly shared. However, the underlying algorithm in this implementation is exactly the same as the algorithm mentioned in the paper.
